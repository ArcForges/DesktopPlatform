# DesktopPlatform contributor instructions

This repository owns shared desktop mechanisms, C# interop, CMake/vcpkg and capability NuGet production.
The product applications, Cloud, AI, Web, Mobile and business RPC schemas have separate repositories.
The accepted architecture lives in [ArcForges-Design](https://github.com/ArcForges/ArcForges-Design).

- Work on a focused branch in `.worktree/`. Preserve the primary checkout and unrelated repositories.
- Use C# 14 / .NET 10 from `global.json`, C++20 and C17-compatible public C ABI headers.
- Keep native toolchains here. Consumers use exact published package versions and committed lock files;
  never add Git submodules or sibling source dependencies. Business proto generation belongs to Contracts.
- Put dependency versions in `Directory.Packages.props`, restore locked, retain warnings-as-errors and
  AOT/trim diagnostics. Native interop uses owned C ABI / LibraryImport, never a C++ ABI.
- Add SPDX headers to source/configuration; preserve third-party notices and source provenance.
- New projects are non-packable by default. Admit a package explicitly in `eng/packaging/packages.json`
  only when its behavior and dependency closure are verified. Never publish placeholders as capabilities.
- Keep build inputs declarative; executable packaging verification is the portable Python tool under `eng/`.
  Do not add tracked PowerShell or shell helper scripts.
- Record what actually ran. A successful package-policy smoke does not prove native capability AOT,
  product behavior, release signing or NuGet publication. Run the checks documented in the README.

## Validation policy (P2-017)

Follow the [current CI/local authority](https://github.com/ArcForges/ArcForges-Design/blob/47db6670a727317939b91245e8c0b288834acf99/docs/assurance/ci-and-local-validation-policy.md).
- Never add or execute macOS CI, native/runtime/package-consumer execution, GUI, browser, device, live-service or published-package installation tests in any CI trigger or nested build script.
- Keep necessary Windows/Linux compilation, packaging, targeted offline unit/static checks and non-duplicated security checks. Runtime diagnostics are explicit local opt-in only for affected behavior using existing tools. Do not silently build/test from commit or push hooks.
- Preserve locks, required signatures, licence/provenance and one identity/integrity check at each real trust handoff. Do not routinely download public artifacts or repeat archive/hash/consumer verification after publication. Narrow FFmpeg licence/configuration and Windows signature inspection remain legal admission checks.
- Do not reinstall vcpkg, SDKs or toolchains to expand validation. Do not create tags or republish solely for verification. Stop on a network failure and report the exact operation; no proxy configuration, port 7890, wsl.exe or WSL wrappers.
- Record removed coverage honestly. Review the complete latest PR and merge only after applicable checks succeed. Post-merge work stops after commit/job/publication status and a clean primary fast-forward; retain branches/worktrees.

## Dependency admission (WP02.05)

- Keep `eng/policy/dependency-policy.json` bound to the complete actual dependency inputs. A dependency or framework change requires a reviewed replacement receipt, closure/licence and maintenance review and every upgrade checklist item. Hash refresh alone is insufficient.
- Preserve existing source/native provenance and public/internal import gates. Stable closures cannot import prerelease dependencies; only recorded exact foundation candidates are permitted in development.
- Framework major upgrades require explicit runtime/AOT/trim and affected Android Kotlin/JVM/ART/R8 assessment under VG-08. Record conditional local coverage honestly without adding forbidden CI or provisioning tools.
