# ArcForges.LocalRpc

Generated gRPC over HTTP/2 between a parent and the helper or extension children it owns, and, in the service-endpoint mode (AF-DP-01),
between a long-lived per-user service and its same-user clients, carried only by a Windows Named Pipe or a Unix domain socket. It is packaged as the NuGet package `ArcForges.LocalRpc` in the repository's single-version release set (PLT.16); consumers pin the exact version and keep their committed lock files. The package targets `net10.0` with the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` shared framework, depends only on `Grpc.AspNetCore.Server` and `Grpc.Net.Client` at the versions admitted in `eng/packaging/packages.json`, and references no ArcForges contract or other ArcForges package.

This is transport and framing (WP-08.00), the parent-owned launch identity (WP-08.01), the call bounds on top of
them (WP-08.04), the child registration lifecycle (WP-08.02), static routing with version refusal (WP-08.03) and the disconnect,
cancel and retry semantics of commands (WP-08.05) and the brokered large-data mechanism (WP-08.06). It does not define a
contract: the services it serves are the generated `ArcForges.Contracts.LocalRpc.*` bindings, registered explicitly by their owner. The library
references no contract package: the registration code works on bytes, ids and the generated service's method names, and the owner's generated
`LocalBootstrapService` implementation is the thin mapping between its messages and the registration (the tests contain one).

## What it provides

- `LocalRpcEndpoint` validates an address: a flat Windows pipe name, or a canonical absolute Unix socket path of
  at most 100 UTF-8 bytes. A pipe is refused off Windows and a socket is refused on Windows. There is no host,
  port, URL, discovery manifest or DNS name.
- `LocalRpcServer` hosts Kestrel with a custom `IConnectionListenerFactory` that can bind nothing but this
  transport; its builder registers each generated service explicitly (`AddService`) and nothing is found by
  scanning. The host is a generic web host; it does read `ASPNETCORE_*` settings into host configuration,
  but its only Kestrel endpoint is the explicit private one, which overrides any URL or port setting, so no address
  results, and `ASPNETCORE_PREFERHOSTINGURLS=true` makes startup fail. The other connection listener factories are
  removed, and `StartAsync` fails closed if any non-local address is bound. An optional connection decision
  (`AuthorizeConnections`, or `AuthorizeConnectionsAsync` with a cancellable asynchronous decision) runs on every
  accepted connection before HTTP/2 reads a byte. The decision runs on the thread pool, off the accept loop; a decision that
  throws, does not finish within `LocalRpcLimits.AuthorizationTimeout` (default 2 s, whether it yields or blocks its thread, in
  either overload) or is cancelled denies the connection. A decision that ignores its token and never returns keeps its
  pool thread. Stopping the server cancels a pending decision and drops the stream unread. The decision sees the transport, a sequence number and, for a listening
  endpoint, that endpoint; in a parent-child server it does not see the peer process or user (a service-mode server resolves the peer first;
  see the service-endpoint mode below).
- At most `MaxConnections` connections are served at once. The listener waits for a free slot before it accepts, so
  an extra peer waits in the OS backlog (16) and is served when a slot frees; it is not reset. A peer that holds a slot
  without calling is closed by the handshake and idle limits below.
- `LocalRpcStreamSupplier` is the launcher's hand-over of already-connected OS streams. A server built over a
  supplier accepts only those streams.
- `LocalRpcClientChannel` is a `GrpcChannel` over `http://arcforges.invalid` whose `ConnectCallback` returns
  only the verified OS stream: one HTTP/2 connection, no retry, hedging, load balancing, connection recycling
  or fallback to DNS/TCP, and no compression providers.
- gRPC messages are limited to 4 MiB in both directions (`LocalRpcLimits`). Compression is refused: a request that
  names any `grpc-encoding` other than `identity` is answered `UNIMPLEMENTED` before routing and before any
  decompression, so the bound holds for the decoded size as well. Detailed error text is off.

## Call bounds (WP-08.04)

Every connected peer (one connection) has its own lanes; a peer that saturates its lanes does not slow another.

- **Data lane: 16 active, 64 queued.** A call that is routed to a registered gRPC method (an unknown service is
  answered `UNIMPLEMENTED` before admission) takes one of 16 active slots or waits for one in arrival order in a queue
  of 64. Inside the gate the queue is strictly first in, first out and a freed slot is handed to the oldest waiter; that is
  order of arrival at the admission gate, not order on the wire (the server starts concurrent requests on the thread pool,
  so calls submitted back to back can reach the gate slightly out of submission order). A call over the
  bounds is refused before dispatch and before its body is read. `LocalRpcLimits` may lower the numbers, never raise them.
- **Two reserved control slots.** Methods the owner declares with `RegisterControl` (bootstrap, lease renewal,
  cancellation, health) run in two slots of their own, outside the data budget, so 16 data calls and 2 control calls run at
  the same time. A control call never waits: a third concurrent control call is refused at once. `StartAsync` fails when a
  declared control method is not served by a registered service, so a misspelled name cannot silently run as a data
  call. Nothing is declared by default: the library names no contract method, the owner of each service declares its own.
- **Deadlines.** A data call without a deadline gets 10 s, a declared deadline is shortened to at most 30 s, and a control
  call is held to 5 s. Time spent waiting for a slot counts: a call whose deadline passes in the queue is refused
  `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` without dispatch, and an admitted call is handed the time that remains. The slot is held until the
  handler actually returns, so the active bound counts running code even for a handler that ignores its deadline;
  that handler pins its slot, and the control slots exist so that cancellation and lease renewal still get through.
- **Typed refusal.** A refused call fails with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` (data lane full, control slots busy, callback with no
  free slot) or `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, plus the trailers `x-af-refusal` and `x-af-dispatched: 0`;
  `LocalRpcRefusal.TryRead` reads them. Any other failure may or may not have dispatched.
- **Memory.** Two different amounts, stated separately. *Not yet dispatched:* a waiting call costs one queue node and at
  most the HTTP/2 stream window it was granted, which the host pins to 64 KiB (Kestrel's minimum); the worst case for the
  100 streams of one connection is 6.25 MiB of unread request body, 50 MiB across the 8 connections. *Dispatched:* the 16
  admitted calls of a connection may each hold a request and a response of up to 4 MiB, about 128 MiB per connection and
  about 1 GiB across 8 connections. The connection window is flow-control credit, not memory, and it is pinned to 3 x 100 x
  64 KiB (18.75 MiB). Kestrel returns connection credit in half-window steps, so progress needs a free pool of at least half
  the window while every other stream's body sits unread (2 x the 6.25 MiB the streams can hold, plus margin). Smaller
  windows were wrong twice and each failure was reproduced: at 128 KiB two queued 64 KiB bodies stopped every other call on
  the connection, and at 6.25 MiB a burst of 80 concurrent calls with 256 KiB bodies left 16 admitted calls waiting for body
  credit that never came and a health call on the same connection timed out.
- **Silent and idle peers.** A connection that does not begin a call within 10 s of being accepted is closed, and so is a
  connection with no call in flight for 60 s (twice the 30 s lease; a live peer renews every 10 s). A closed connection frees
  its connection slot. A call that is in flight, even one waiting in the queue, keeps its connection open. The limits are about silence, not
  lifetime: a peer that makes one cheap call every 59 s keeps its slot, and nothing accounts per caller. The clock starts when
  a connection is accepted, so a launcher that supplies a stream before its child is ready must raise `HandshakeTimeout`.
  A timer that fires slightly before the clock agrees is re-armed for the remainder rather than dropped.
- **Callbacks.** The reverse direction is a second server and client channel over a separately provisioned, parent-created
  stream, with its own lanes, so callbacks are never queued behind the other direction's data calls. A call made from inside
  a handler carries a marker; the receiving server never queues a marked call (a marked call that finds no free slot is
  refused at once), and a call made from inside such a callback handler is refused by the client before it is sent. Two
  saturated lanes therefore cannot wait on each other. The marker is cooperative and protects first-party endpoints;
  a hostile peer that omits it is still held to the data bounds, the deadlines and the connection limits.
- **Not done here:** there is no client-side limit on outgoing calls (the server refuses the excess), no per-caller
  fairness inside one connection, and the 16/64 bound is per connection, so several connections each have their own
  (the connection bound of 8 limits the total). A call to an unknown service is answered `UNIMPLEMENTED` without admission,
  so a flood of them is limited only by the stream and connection caps. No streaming method exists in the pinned contracts and
  streaming calls are untested here (they would hold a slot until they end; the service mode's stream lane is below). The library has not been published with Native AOT by
  this task; only the static trim and AOT analyzers ran.

## Disconnect, cancel and retry (WP-08.05)

Everything in this section is **in memory**: a restart of the parent or of a helper loses it. Durable receipts and exactly-once effects across
a process restart belong to the persistence tasks (WP-07/21/52); here a command whose helper died resolves to a typed *unknown effect*, and the owner's
own durable record resolves it.

- **Effect certainty.** `LocalRpcEffect` is `DidNotHappen`, `Happened` or `Unknown`, with the same numbers as the published `EffectCertainty`
  (the library does not reference the Foundation packages, so the test project asserts the equality). `LocalRpcCommandOutcome<T>` mirrors
  `Outcome<T>`: a success, a failure or a cancellation, each with an effect and a typed `LocalRpcFailureReason`. An unknown effect is a failure or a
  cancellation whose effect is `Unknown`; the owner maps it onto its own typed failure.
- **Command identity.** `LocalRpcCommand` is the owner-minted command id, the wire operation (`full.service.Name/Method`), a 32-byte digest of the
  canonical input and the idempotency class: `Query` (read; retried, never recorded), `DuplicateSafe` (the owner's handler returns the recorded result
  for the same id and input within one helper launch) or `NonIdempotent`. The same id always names the same operation, input and class; anything else is
  a `CommandConflict` and nothing is sent. `ReplayAfterUnknown` is the owner's explicit permission to send a command again after an unknown effect, and only a
  `DuplicateSafe` command may carry it.
- **What proves an effect did not happen.** Exactly three things: a typed refusal the peer attached before dispatch (`x-af-refusal` with `x-af-dispatched: 0`),
  a failure to open the stream (`LocalRpcConnectException`, which `LocalRpcClientChannel` now raises from its connect callback, so a call that fails with it was
  never sent) and an effect trailer from the helper's receipt table (`x-af-effect`). Anything else after a request may have been sent (a broken stream, a deadline, a
  cancelled call, any other status) leaves the effect `Unknown`. A later attempt that is refused or finds no connection proves only itself: it cannot turn an earlier
  unknown attempt of the same command into `DidNotHappen`; only the helper's own report can.
- **`LocalRpcCommandExecutor`** keeps a bounded journal of commands by id (default 4096; a command in flight or unknown is never forgotten, a settled one is kept
  for 10 minutes so a duplicate submission is answered from the record, and a full journal refuses a new command with `JournalFull` rather than evicting an old one). A call
  runs the `send` delegate the owner supplies (the generated stub call), with the caller's token linked to the loss of the launch, and then:
  - *Success*: recorded with its response. A response can report its own effect through the `interpret` delegate (for example from an `ArcError`); a response that reports
    anything but `Happened` is a typed `ReportedByPeer` failure that keeps the response.
  - *Refusal or no connection* (effect `DidNotHappen`): retried after a full-jitter wait (250 ms doubling to 30 s, `LocalRpcBackoff`) up to `MaxAttempts` (default 3), whatever the
    class, because nothing happened. A refusal that will repeat itself (`RecursiveCallback`, `CommandConflict`) is not retried. The command may be started again later under the same id.
  - *Unknown effect*: recorded as `Unknown` and **not sent again**. A call sends it again only when its command allows replay, it is `DuplicateSafe`, the failure was a lost
    stream, a deadline, a refusal or a missing connection, the launch is the one the command was first sent to (the generation is fixed per call; a later call to another launch is refused
    with `ReplayNotAllowed`, because the new launch has no receipts and a replay would run the effect twice) and the replay window (5 minutes from the first attempt, shorter than the
    helper's 10-minute receipt retention) has not passed.
  - *The caller's token*: abandons the call. Before the first send nothing is recorded and the effect is `DidNotHappen`; after it the effect stays `Unknown` and the command is not replayed
    on its own.
  - *`PeerLost` / `WatchPeer`*: the owner declares a launch lost (its process exited, its lease lapsed, its `Revoked` token fired). Every command in flight on it is aborted: an attempt that may
    have been sent is `Unknown`, a command that was only waiting to retry stays `DidNotHappen`.
  - *`ReconcileAsync`*: the owner asks where the effect lives (its durable store, or a contract query such as a read of the object the command changed) and the answer settles an unknown command:
    `Happened` is a success without a response, `DidNotHappen` allows the command to start again under the same id.
  - *`CancelAsync`*: records the cancel intent first (it survives the loss of the helper and stops every retry and replay of that command), then carries it to the helper through a delegate the
    owner supplies. The helper's report settles it: `DidNotHappen` (stopped before the commit point), `Happened` (too late) or `Unknown`. A cancel that cannot be delivered leaves the command cancelled with an unknown effect
    and can be sent again when the helper is back.
- **`LocalRpcCommandReceipts`** is the helper's side. It records each command by id in the helper's memory and runs its effect at most once per helper launch however often the command arrives: a duplicate
  with the same input joins the running effect or is answered from the record, the same id with another input is refused `command-conflict` and a full table `receipts-full`, both before the effect runs (typed refusals).
  The effect runs under a token the call does not own, so **a disconnect does not stop it**: a parent that lost the answer can ask again and get it. The effect names its commit point with
  `LocalRpcCommandContext.Commit()`: before it an explicit cancel (or the effect timeout, 30 s, or shutdown) stops the effect and nothing happened, after it the effect counts as having happened even if it throws
  afterwards, and `Commit()` throws if a cancel came first. An effect must change nothing durable before it commits. A failed command is reported as an `RpcException` carrying `x-af-effect`
  (`LocalRpcCommandReceipts.TryReadEffect`). Responses are kept for replay within a byte budget (32 MiB; the caller states each response's size); a response that is no longer kept is reported as
  `FAILED_PRECONDITION` with the effect `happened`. A helper that dies takes the table with it.
- **Limits of cancel and of a failed command (stated, not hidden).** `CancelAsync` takes no launch: the executor trusts the report the owner's delegate returns and cannot check that it came from the launch the command was sent to, so an owner must send the cancel to that launch. A cancel that reaches the helper before the command does leaves no record there (the table has nothing to cancel), so the command can still run afterwards and be reported `Happened`. A command that fails before its commit point stays recorded as `DidNotHappen` in the helper's table: the same command id gets that answer for the table's retention (10 minutes), and a fresh run needs a new command id. An effect value that is not one of the three certainties (unspecified, or a number outside the enum), whether from `interpret` or from a cancel report, is treated as `Unknown`.
- **Cancellation uses the reserved control slots.** The owner declares its cancel method with `RegisterControl(LocalRpcControlOperation.Cancellation, ...)` and its handler calls
  `LocalRpcCommandReceipts.CancelAsync`; the call then runs in one of the peer's two control slots outside the 16/64 data budget (`LocalRpcServer.GetBoundsSnapshot().ControlAdmitted` counts it). The library
  names no contract method. The pinned Platform contract has no cancel and no health method; the Sandbox contract's `CancelSession` exists but this repository does not admit that package, so the tests'
  cancel wire is a hand-written test-only service (`CommandProbe`), as the call-bounds tests' was (`BoundsProbe`). Admitting the Sandbox package, and proving cancellation through `CancelSession`, belongs to
  the tasks that consume it (PLT.15, PLT.45).

## Parent-owned launch identity (WP-08.01)

A parent creates one `LocalRpcLaunchAuthority` (`Create(runtimeRoot)`), and each child it starts is one
`Launch(slot, identity, transport)`:

- **Descriptor.** `LocalRpcLaunchDescriptor` is the parent's immutable record of the launch: launch id, slot, epoch,
  endpoint (or none when the launcher supplies streams), the parent process (id and start time), the expected child kind,
  build id and digest, protocol version and contract-set digest, a random 32-byte nonce, the issue time and the bootstrap
  deadline (default 30 s). `Encode`/`Decode` are one canonical versioned binary form that refuses truncation, trailing
  bytes and every malformed value as `FormatException`. The descriptor holds no secret.
- **Epoch fencing.** A slot is one logical child. Launching a slot again gives the next epoch and revokes the previous
  launch, so a descriptor of an older epoch is stale and `Verify` refuses it whatever else it carries. Epochs are per
  authority and in memory: they do not survive a parent restart (a new parent has a new process identity and random launch
  ids, so an old descriptor matches nothing; registration freshness after a restart belongs to the registration task).
- **Claims.** A child makes a `LocalRpcLaunchClaim` from its descriptor. `Verify` checks, in order: the launch is not
  revoked, the descriptor was issued by this running process, a bound child process still runs, the bootstrap window has not
  passed, the launch id/slot/epoch, the nonce (fixed-time), the child kind/build id/build digest, and the protocol version
  and contract-set digest. Each failure has its own `LocalRpcLaunchRefusal`; callers must not reveal which one to a child.
  Build id, build digest, kind and protocol are compared with what the child claims: nothing here measures the child's binary,
  so a matching claim is not an attestation of the executable (the launcher's signed-inventory check owns that).
- **One-use secret.** Each launch holds a random 32-byte secret. `HandoffBootstrapResource()` returns the descriptor
  followed by the secret once, for the launcher to write into a private inherited resource (never argv, environment or a
  file) and clear. `ConsumeSecret` runs a callback over the secret exactly once, destroys it whatever the outcome and, when the callback
  returns and the launch still authorizes, ends the bootstrap window. It refuses (the secret is destroyed, the callback does not run,
  `InvalidOperationException`) when the launch does not authorize at the start: expired, revoked, issuing parent gone or bound child
  gone. A callback that finishes after the deadline does not extend the launch (expiry is latched), and a callback that throws leaves
  the window running with the secret spent. The callback runs outside the launch lock, over a copy that is zeroed when it returns, throws
  or is refused. **A callback that returns, whatever its result, ends the bootstrap window**: a caller that rejects the proof must
  revoke the launch itself (the registration task does). The bootstrap window runs out on whichever clock gets there first, the
  monotonic one (a wall-clock step back cannot extend it) or the wall clock (a step forward, or a suspended machine, shortens it); when
  expiry is first seen it is latched and the stored secret is destroyed. The secret is zeroed in managed memory only: it is not pinned, locked or protected from a debugger. The
  HMAC transcript that uses it is the registration task's.
- **Child process.** `BindChild` records the launcher's verified child process (id and start time); from then on the launch
  authorizes only while that process runs. The check happens when a claim or connection is decided; no watcher runs, so a
  child that exits is noticed at the next decision. Process start values are compared within 2 s. On Windows and macOS the start
  value is the UTC start time. On Linux it is the start in clock ticks since boot read from `/proc/<pid>/stat` (USER_HZ taken as 100),
  because the start time .NET reports on Linux follows the wall clock; a process that is gone or a zombie counts as dead, an unreadable
  `/proc` entry as unknown. The value is ticks since boot, so a record written before a reboot whose process id and tick happen to
  coincide with a running process is taken as that process: the directory is kept, never deleted (it fails safe). The Linux path
  ran only in hosted CI (a self-probe and the parser tests), and the reboot case was not exercised at all.
- **Endpoint files.** A private endpoint on Linux/macOS is a socket inside a per-launch directory of an owner-only root. The
  root and each launch directory are created with owner-only access in the same call (mode 0700 on Unix, a protected DACL
  naming only the current user on Windows), a launch directory is built under a temporary name with its record and renamed into
  place, and it is removed by renaming it away and then deleting it. The record names the launch id, parent process and epoch
  (its endpoint-address field is written empty) and no nonce or secret. Existing roots must not be links and must be owner-only: on
  Windows the owner must be the current user or Administrators and any allow rule for another principal than the current user, SYSTEM or
  Administrators is refused; on Unix the check is the mode only (no group or other bits), with no ownership check, so a directory owned by
  someone else with mode 0700 fails closed for an ordinary user but a root parent is not protected. On Windows the private endpoint is a Named Pipe with
  an unguessable per-launch name and no file.
- **Parent death.** A killed parent runs no cleanup. `Create` and `SweepStale` remove a launch directory only when its creator is proven
  gone: its record names a parent that is not running (id and start value compared, so a recycled id counts as gone), or it has no record at
  all and is older than 60 s; leftover removals go at once and a temporary directory that was never renamed into place after 60 s (the sweep
  never opens anything inside it). A record that exists but cannot be read or understood (a newer format, damage, a handle held by another
  program) proves nothing, so that directory is never removed and accumulates until someone clears it. A directory of a running or unverifiable
  parent, a link, or anything this library did not create is never touched. Launches abandoned in memory are not detected; an owner disposes each
  launch (`DisposeAsync`), and disposing the authority disposes every launch it issued.
- **Connections.** `launch.AuthorizeConnectionAsync` is the decision for a server built over the launch's endpoint or streams. It
  admits a connection only while the launch authorizes and only when the connection arrived on the launch's own endpoint.
  Revoking a launch cancels `Revoked`; the owner closes its server connections then, since an HTTP/2 connection admitted earlier
  stays open until the owner closes it. `Revoked` callbacks run synchronously on the thread that revoked, outside the authority's lock, so
  they may call the authority. An exception a callback throws is swallowed: the launch is revoked either way and the failure does not
  reach the caller that caused the revocation (for example the launch call that superseded it).

## Child registration lifecycle (WP-08.02)

A launch (above) is the parent's side of one child; a `LocalRpcRegistration` (`LocalRpcRegistration.Create(launch)`) is the
authenticated registration on it, and `LocalRpcServerBuilder.RequireRegistration(registration)` serves it. A registration serves
one server and one connection.

- **Bootstrap (annex 09 section 2).** The child sends its instance id, 32 random bytes and the child kind, build and protocol it claims
  (`Challenge`); the parent answers with a challenge id, 32 random bytes, its own instance id and a lifetime of five seconds. The
  child confirms with `HMAC-SHA256(secret, "arcforges.local.bootstrap.v1" || challenge UUID || client bytes || server bytes || client
  instance UUID || server instance UUID)` (every UUID as its 16 big-endian bytes; the proof is checked against an independently
  computed value). A challenge belongs to the connection it was issued on, is used once, and a new challenge replaces the earlier
  one of that connection. The first confirmation that holds a live challenge on its connection consumes the launch secret whatever
  the proof is, and **a proof that does not match revokes the launch**: that child can only be relaunched. A confirmation on
  another connection, naming another challenge, or after the five seconds is refused without touching the secret. A claimed
  child kind, build, build digest, protocol or contract-set digest that differs from the launch is refused as well (not a revocation);
  nothing measures the child's executable, so a matching claim is not an attestation (the launcher's signed-inventory check owns that).
- **Lease and renewal.** A proven confirmation grants a random 32-byte peer nonce and a 30-second lease; the child renews every
  10 seconds (`LocalRpcLeaseKeeper`) and a renewal sets the lease to 30 seconds from the renewal. Only a renewal extends the lease,
  never an ordinary call. The lease is judged on the monotonic and on the wall clock, whichever gets there first, and expiry is
  latched; a watchdog timer ends an unrenewed registration at its expiry without any call, and a timer that fires early re-arms for the
  remainder. A renewal command id seen before returns the expiry recorded for it and extends nothing (the last 16 command ids are
  remembered); an expired registration is never renewed or revived.
- **Every call is checked before routing.** The gate answers, before any handler, queue slot or unknown-service answer, with one
  `UNAUTHENTICATED` status that names no cause, unless the call is one of the two bootstrap steps of an unregistered child (matched by
  exact path) or carries `x-af-peer-bin` (the nonce), `x-af-instance-bin` (16-byte caller instance) and `x-af-contract-set` (the launch's contract-set
  digest, 64 hex digits) that match the registration on the registered connection within the lease. Any other spelling of a bootstrap
  path needs credentials. The bootstrap steps and the renewal are declared as control operations, so they use the reserved control
  slots of the call bounds and a saturated data lane cannot starve a registration (refused calls never reach admission at all).
- **Epoch fencing and fresh grants.** A registration ends, for good, when the lease passes, its connection closes, a newer epoch of
  the slot supersedes the launch (at once, not at the lease), the launch is revoked, its parent or bound child process is gone, the proof
  is rejected or it is disposed; ending it revokes the launch. A registered child is admitted no second connection. A relaunch is the
  next epoch with a new endpoint, secret, instance id and nonce: nothing of the old grant is inherited and the old child's
  credentials mean nothing to the new registration. A restarted parent is a new process with a new authority, whose epochs start at 1
  again, so the epoch number alone fences nothing there: the old credentials fail because they match no launch, secret or nonce of the new run
  (the old parent's registrations end when it dies, and a stale launch is refused as a parent mismatch).
- **Owner's service.** The owner implements the generated `LocalBootstrapService`; the gate gives each of its calls a
  `LocalRpcBootstrapCall` (`ServerCallContext.GetBootstrapCall()`) with the three steps. The call carries the connection the call arrived
  on, so a service cannot name another connection; a service that finds no bootstrap call (a server without the gate) must refuse.
  A child uses `LocalRpcChildBootstrap` (the bootstrap resource, the single-use proof, the credentials interceptor) and
  `LocalRpcLeaseKeeper`; both clear what they hold.
- **What the peer sees.** One refusal status for every cause, so the gate is no oracle for the secret, the nonce or the state.
  The parent sees the cause (`LocalRpcRegistrationRefusal`, `EndReason`).

Known limits, stated exactly: a same-user process that learns the endpoint and gets a challenge on its own connection can burn the
launch with a wrong proof (the specified behavior: the launch is revoked and relaunched). The secret and nonce are zeroed in managed memory
only. The lease watchdog and connection loss end the registration but this library neither kills the child process nor stops the server:
the owner does that when `Ended` is cancelled.

## Static routing and version refusal (WP-08.03)

A parent routes only to children it launched and registered itself, and only to the generated services those children declared.
Nothing is discovered: there is no search by service name, no registry, path or installed-product lookup, and a refusal never
falls back to another slot, another child or another product.

- **Declarations.** `LocalRpcServiceDeclaration` is one generated service of a child: its full protobuf service name, the contract
  majors it serves (one to eight, never 0) and the capability names it offers (at most 32, compared exactly, case included).
  `LocalRpcChildDeclaration` is the closed set of services of one child kind (one to sixteen, each name once). The parent writes
  both from what it knows statically about the child it launches (its signed inventory); the child's wire claims never create a route,
  and the library names no contract: the owner passes the generated service's name.
- **Router.** `LocalRpcRouter.Add(registration, declaration)` adds one launched child explicitly, under the slot its launch fixed; the
  declaration's kind must be the launch's kind. A slot holds one child while its registration lives (adding to it is refused) and an
  ended registration is replaced, so a relaunch (the next epoch, which revokes the earlier launch at once) is routable only after its
  own registration is added. `TryResolve(request, out route)` takes one slot, one service, the contract major the caller was built
  against and the capabilities it needs, and answers in a fixed order, the first failure being the answer: `InvalidRequest`, `UnknownChild`
  (never added; a launch the authority issued is not a route), `ChildNotRegistered`, `ChildEnded` (lease passed, launch superseded or
  revoked, process gone, disposed: never revived), `ServiceNotDeclared` (no other child is consulted, whatever it declares),
  `VersionUnsupported` (the major is not one the child serves), `CapabilityUnsupported`. Resolving touches nothing: it does not
  extend a lease or change a registration, though a lease found over ends the registration, as any call would.
- **Route guard.** `LocalRpcResolvedRoute.CreateGuard()` is a client interceptor for the channel to that child. It refuses every kind of
  call to a service other than the route's (`UNIMPLEMENTED`, `LocalRpcRefusalReason.UnroutedService`) and every call once the child's
  registration is not live (`FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `RouteNotLive`), by throwing an `RpcException` before the call reaches the channel;
  `LocalRpcRefusal.TryRead` reads it and says nothing was dispatched. A route to the old epoch of a relaunched slot, or to a child whose
  lease passed, therefore calls nothing. The guard has no map from methods to capabilities: the capability check is the resolution.
- **Declared services of a server.** `LocalRpcServerBuilder.RequireDeclaredServices(declaration)` makes `StartAsync` fail, with nothing
  listening, unless the services added with `AddService` are exactly the declared ones: a served service that was not declared and a
  declared service that is not served are both named. With `RequireRegistration` the declaration must be for the launch's child kind and
  must name the LocalBootstrap service. A call to a service that is not registered is answered `UNIMPLEMENTED` by the server before
  admission and dispatch (as before this task; the registration gate answers an unregistered caller first).
- **Version evidence.** What a caller's contract set must equal is fixed by the launch (WP-08.01/08.02): a child claiming another
  protocol version or contract-set digest is refused at bootstrap, and a call presenting another `x-af-contract-set` is refused by the
  gate with the single `UNAUTHENTICATED` answer. This task adds the per-service contract major the router checks against the
  declaration. The router does not derive a service's majors from the launch's protocol version, and the `contract_majors` a child puts
  in its endpoint manifest are not consulted (the registration API takes none): the declaration is the parent's own knowledge.

Known limits, stated exactly: the guard does not follow channels that bypass it (a caller can still build a client without it), a
declaration says nothing about what a child binary really serves (nothing measures it; the signed-inventory check owns that), ended
entries stay in the router until their slot is added again, and nothing here was run with Native AOT, on Linux or macOS beyond the hosted offline
suite, or over a real OS stream.

## Brokered large data (WP-08.06)

Bulk bytes never travel as gRPC messages. A parser result larger than a message goes through a slot: shared memory the
launcher provisioned before the helper started (annex 09 section 4), and only small control records cross the stream. This
library is the slot protocol, independent of any contract and of how the memory is created: the launcher hands each slot to the
broker as an `ILocalRpcBufferMapping`, and the generated sandbox bindings (owned by the helper task) carry the records below.

- **The parent is the only authority.** `LocalRpcBrokerSession` is the parent's side of one invocation: one to three slots, each of
  1 byte through 64 MiB, a parent-minted invocation, lease and generation. `LocalRpcBrokerChild` is the helper's side. There is
  no ticket, handle or address that a helper or a product could pass to another product: a seal or acknowledgement of one session
  is refused by every other session (`WrongSession`), and nothing here exposes a mapping to a second reader.
- **Slot order: free, writing, sealed, reading, free.** `Grant(slot, capacity)` gives a free slot its next sequence (1, then one
  more after each acknowledgement; a sequence never wraps) and the capacity the helper may fill. The helper's `Accept` takes only
  a free slot, a sequence higher than any it accepted before and a capacity inside its mapping, and `Seal` returns the digest
  of exactly the bytes written, inside the granted range. The parent's `Seal` checks, in this order, the session (invocation,
  lease and generation), the slot, the slot state, the sequence, that the range is non-empty and inside the *granted* capacity
  (not the mapping's), and, when the parent passes the layout it expects, that the declared row stride fits the length
  (`stride >= rowBytes` and `(rows-1)*stride + rowBytes <= length <= rows*stride`); a seal without a layout may not declare a stride.
  A refused seal changes nothing, so the grant stays outstanding.
- **Private copy, digest on the copy.** `CopyAsync` copies the sealed range into a buffer only the parent owns, in chunks of at
  most `ChunkBytes` (default 256 KiB, 4 KiB through 4 MiB), digests that private copy and compares it with the sealed digest.
  Bytes the helper writes during or after the copy cannot change the returned buffer; a digest that does not match ends the
  invocation (`IntegrityViolation`). At most one copy, with its undisposed `LocalRpcVerifiedBuffer`, exists per session. Between
  chunks the copy checks cancellation, the lease and the caller's token; the caller's own cancellation only abandons that attempt
  (the slot stays sealed and the copy may be retried). A mapping that fails or returns the wrong number of bytes ends the invocation.
  Disposing the buffer zeroes it. The session's mappings are released only once no copy is still reading one.
- **Acknowledgement.** `Acknowledge` is accepted only after a copy was verified; it returns the digest of the parent's private copy,
  frees the slot and raises its next sequence. The helper's `Acknowledge` frees a sealed slot only when invocation, lease, generation,
  slot, sequence and digest all match. The same acknowledgement again is harmless (the last one per slot is remembered); any
  other sequence is stale and a different digest is refused.
- **Cancellation, expiry, loss of the pair.** `Cancel` withdraws every slot in use for the rest of the invocation (a slot is never
  recycled after it), stops a copy in progress within one chunk and refuses everything after it. The owner closes the session when the
  helper has confirmed; if it has not within `CancelGrace` (5 s) the session closes itself with `CancelUnresponsive`, which asks the
  owner to terminate the helper. The 30 s lease is renewed with `Renew` (every 10 s by the owner), and an expired session closes by itself,
  is never revived and reports `Expired`. A timer that fires a little early waits out the remainder. `PairGone` (a cancellation token,
  for example a launch's `Revoked`) and a `PairLives` check on every renewal close the session. Closing releases every mapping
  once, ends the session once through `Ended` (called outside every lock, its failures swallowed) and removes it from the registry; an
  `Ended` reason other than `Closed` and `RegistryDisposed` asks the owner to terminate the helper. The helper side cancels with
  `LocalRpcBrokerChild.Cancel`, which also cancels its `Cancelled` token for the parser. Nothing here notices a dead connection by
  itself: the owner calls `Cancel`/`Close` (parent) or `Cancel` (helper) when its stream ends, and the lease is the backstop
  (at most 30 s without renewal).
- **Cancellation under load uses the reserved control slots.** The broker does not declare any method: the owner declares its
  cancellation and lease-renewal methods with `RegisterControl`, and only then do they bypass a full data lane (the tests show the same
  cancel refused behind 16 active and 64 queued calls when it is not declared).
- **Input check.** `LocalRpcBrokerChild.VerifyInputAsync` reads the helper's read-only input in bounded chunks and compares its
  length and SHA-256 with the parent-minted ones before any parser sees it.
- **Bounds.** A registry admits at most `MaxSessions` sessions (default 8, the connection bound) and one session per invocation. The
  private copies are therefore bounded by that many times 64 MiB; the slot mappings are the launcher's.
  These are limits, not measurements.

**A peer that stops reading is a known limit of the bounds layer, not solved here.** The 16/64 bounds count a call only while its
handler runs. A test (`AReaderThatStopsReadingMultiMegabyteResponses...`) made 16 calls whose responses were about 4 MiB each to a client that
stopped reading: the handlers returned at once (no admission slot stayed pinned, another peer was served normally), the server wrote
about 60 KB to the stalled connection, and the in-process managed heap grew by about 69 MB (claimant-reported local figure from one
run on Windows; the test bounds it at one response per call) until the client read again, after which all 16 responses arrived intact.
Those buffered responses are therefore outside the 16 active / 64 queued bounds and are limited only by the 100-stream cap of a
connection and the 8 connections: by reasoning, not measured, about 400 MiB per connection and about 3.2 GiB in all, so the memory model of the call-bounds section (128 MiB per connection, about 1 GiB over 8) understates the worst case. This is an open follow-up against the call-bounds layer. Brokered transfers avoid it by design, since
their calls carry descriptors, but any large unary response of another service does not. Streaming calls were not tested.

Not done here, so nothing above claims it: creating or handing over the OS mappings and the launch allowlist (the helper host
task); the generated `ContentSandboxService` bindings (the package is not admitted in this repository, so the mapping of
`SandboxSlotGrant`, `SandboxBufferDescriptor` and `SandboxBufferAck` onto these records is untested here and the tests use a
hand-written service); validation of the format, kind and pixel geometry of a buffer beyond the stride rule, and tile coverage
across a whole frame (no missing or overlapping tiles); the `ResourceAccess` `OpenRead`/`ReadChunk` transfer ticket for extension
children (this library provides no ticket of any kind); reading the peer's OS identity; zeroing a verified buffer the owner still
holds when a session ends; and any run with a real helper process, a real shared mapping or an OS other than Windows.

## Service-endpoint mode (AF-DP-01)

Everything above is the parent-child helper server, and it is unchanged: it stays the default, with its 8 connections, 10 s / 30 s data
deadlines, 60 s idle close and no peer identity in the connection decision. `LocalRpcServerOptions.Mode = LocalRpcServerMode.Service`
makes a long-lived per-user service instead (ArcForges-Design `docs/reuse/desktopplatform-refactor.md` §1, `docs/architecture/02-node-service.md`
§2–3, `docs/architecture/11-security-privacy.md` §2):

- **Endpoint.** The owner gives the well-known endpoint. `LocalRpcEndpoint.ForCurrentUserService(name, fallbackDirectory)` computes it the same
  way for server and clients: on Windows the pipe `arcforges-<user hash>-<name>`, on Linux `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/arcforges/<name>.sock`, or
  `<fallbackDirectory>/<name>.sock` when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset. The user hash (`LocalRpcEndpoint.CurrentUserHash`) is the first 16 bytes
  of SHA-256 over the UTF-8 user SID (Windows) or the decimal effective uid (Linux), in lowercase hex. A service listens only on its own endpoint
  of the platform's transport (a Named Pipe on Windows, a Unix socket on Linux); supplied streams, a child registration and any other
  platform are refused when it is built.
- **Access (Windows).** Every pipe instance is created by the library (`CreateNamedPipeW`) with `PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS`, byte mode,
  `FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE` on the first instance (so a name that already exists is never shared or replaced), and a protected access list
  without inherited entries: owner the current user; `GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE` (`FILE_GENERIC_READ | FILE_GENERIC_WRITE`, which includes the
  owner's right to add instances) for the current user and for `SYSTEM`; full access denied to `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK`. The library client
  still checks that the pipe is owned by the current user.
- **Access (Linux).** The socket directory is created with mode 0700 when it is missing; an existing one must be owner-only and not a link. The
  socket is 0600 and never bound over a live server's socket, a link or a directory. An entry left at the path that accepts no connection (the
  socket of a node that died) is removed first; the directory is owner-only, so only this user could have put it there. The directory check is
  the mode only, as for every socket of this library: a directory owned by someone else with mode 0700 fails closed for an ordinary user.
- **Peer identity.** Every accepted connection's peer is resolved once, before HTTP/2 reads a byte and before the owner's decision, within
  `LocalRpcLimits.AuthorizationTimeout`. Windows: `GetNamedPipeClientProcessId`, then `OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION)` and,
  through that one handle, `GetExitCodeProcess`, `GetProcessTimes`, `OpenProcessToken` (the token user SID) and `QueryFullProcessImageNameW`.
  Linux: `SO_PEERCRED` (pid, uid, gid, read with `Socket.GetRawSocketOption`), `/proc/<pid>/stat` for the start (read twice, before and after the
  other reads) and `/proc/<pid>/exe`. A peer is denied, its stream dropped unread, when it cannot be resolved (`Unresolved`), when it has exited
  or its process id now names a process that started after the accept (`ProcessExited`: the id was reused), or when it runs as another user
  (`OtherUser`: token SID or `SO_PEERCRED` uid against the server's own). Otherwise the owner's decision sees it as `LocalRpcConnectionInfo.Peer`,
  and every handler of the connection reads it with `ServerCallContext.GetLocalRpcPeer()` (`LocalRpcPeer`: `ProcessId`, `ProcessStartTime`,
  `UserSid` or `Uid`, `ExecutablePath`, and `Process` in the library's `LocalRpcProcessIdentity` convention). `GetServiceSnapshot()` counts
  admitted peers and denials by reason. A Windows process that exited with code 259 (`STILL_ACTIVE`) reads as running: an OS limit, caught by the
  connection itself being gone. `ExecutablePath` is null when the OS will not say; it is not a security check.
- **Connections.** `MaxConnections` is 64 by default (`LocalRpcLimits.ServiceDefaults`) and may be 1 through 256. The backlog (16) and the slot
  behaviour are unchanged: on Windows an extra pipe client waits for a slot and is not reset. On Linux, connects beyond the backlog that
  arrive faster than the server accepts them fail at once with `EAGAIN`; clients retry with bounded backoff and never read `EAGAIN` as
  "server not running". At 256 connections the per-connection memory figures above multiply by
  256 instead of 8.
- **Idle rule.** A connection holding an open stream is never idle. Otherwise the idle close is 10 minutes (`ServiceDefaults`; at most 10 minutes),
  and Kestrel's own keep-alive close of a connection without active streams is raised past it so that it cannot end a connection first. The
  handshake limit stays 10 s.
- **Per-method deadlines.** `RegisterMethod(method, new LocalRpcCallProfile(default, maximum))` sets one data method's deadline: a call that
  declares none gets the default, a declared one is shortened to the maximum, and waiting for a slot still counts. Methods without a profile keep
  10 s / 30 s. A service-mode profile may raise the deadline up to 120 s (R-API-006); a parent-child profile may only lower it.
- **Stream lane.** `RegisterStream(method, LocalRpcStreamProfile)` runs a server-streaming method in a lane of its own, outside the data and control
  lanes and their 16/64 and 2-slot budgets: at most 8 open streams per connection and 32 per client process over all its connections to the
  server (`MaxStreamCallsPerConnection`, `MaxStreamCallsPerProcess`). A stream over either bound is refused at once with `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` and
  `x-af-refusal: stream-lane-full` (`LocalRpcRefusalReason.StreamLaneFull`, not dispatched); streams never queue. A stream's deadline is the
  shorter of its client's and the profile's `MaxLifetime` (unbounded when both are absent); the 30 s data cap does not apply. When the
  profile's lifetime is the shorter, the library ends the stream at it with `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`, `x-af-stream-end: lifetime-ended` and
  `LifetimeEnded`, after the message in flight; the server's own gRPC deadline is set 1 s later, only as a backstop for a handler that does
  not return. When the client's deadline is the shorter, the client's own timer ends the call at that deadline as well, so the library ends
  the stream 50 ms before it and the trailer is best-effort (the client may report its own `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` first). The handler writes
  through `context.OpenLocalRpcStream(responseStream)` (`LocalRpcStreamWriter<T>`): `TryWrite` queues without waiting and the library moves the
  messages to the transport in order. The library writes no frame of its own: the owner sends heartbeats every `HeartbeatInterval` (15 s by
  default) and the library measures inactivity (`Inactivity`, `HeartbeatOverdue`, the snapshot's `LongestInactivity`). More than
  `MaxBufferedMessages` (2,048 by default) waiting ends the stream: the waiting messages are dropped and the call completes with
  `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` and `x-af-stream-end: overflow` (`LocalRpcStreamEnd.TryRead`) after the data the client has not read yet, so the owner sends
  a reset when the client subscribes again; a client that does not take the message already on its way within `RequireReads` (or the heartbeat
  interval) is reset instead, since a status never passes data that is not read. With `RequireReads` set, a client that does not read within it is
  reset (`ReadsStalled`) and its connection keeps serving. The writer's `Ended` token tells the handler to stop; `CompleteAsync` returns once every
  queued message reached the transport, or throws the status the call must answer. A server-streaming method that is not registered stays a data
  call, as in a parent-child server.
- **Unchanged:** the 4 MiB message bound, no compression, refusal trailers, the control lane, the command journal and receipts, launch
  descriptors and the brokered large-data mechanism.

Known limits, stated exactly: refusal of a second operating-system account is not shown under one account (acceptance register AR-02; the
procedure is in the AF-DP-01 pull request). `PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS` is set on every instance and refuses a client that comes through the
loopback redirector (`\\127.0.0.1\pipe\...`, tested); a client on another machine was not available. Such a loopback client does not present
the `NETWORK` SID, so the network deny entry, which guards against network logons from another machine, is not exercised on one workstation. The
peer identity is what the OS reports for the connecting process; it says nothing about what that process is beyond its executable path (origins
are guardrails, Design 11 §1).

Validation: `LocalRpcServiceModeTests` run offline in CI over real Kestrel HTTP/2 on in-memory streams with a fixed peer answer standing in for
the OS: the configuration rules, the peer in the decision and the handlers, the denials, the per-method deadlines, the stream lane bounds,
lifetime, overflow, stalled readers and inactivity, and the idle and handshake rules on a manual clock. `LocalRpcServiceOsChecks` are the real
operating-system checks (same opt-in variable as above; never in hosted CI): the Windows access list of every instance and the loopback
redirector refusal, a pipe name never shared, the Linux directory and socket modes and the stale-socket rule, the per-user endpoint, 64
connections at once with a 65th waiting, the peer as this process, a peer that exits between accept and query, the process query of a live,
newer and exited child, a profiled call running past 30 s, a stream with heartbeats beside 16 data calls, overflow and stalled readers, and the
idle rule. The 15-minute run with 15 s heartbeats beside 16 data calls, which also shows the 10-minute idle close at its real value, takes 15
minutes and needs `ARCFORGES_LOCALRPC_LONG_STREAM=1` as well. `tests/LocalRpcServiceAotTests` is the Native AOT probe of the mode.

## OS user boundary

A parent-child Named Pipe is created with an explicit owner and protected DACL for the token's user SID; the first instance also
uses `FirstPipeInstance`, so binding fails when the name already has an instance. The client checks the connected server end's owner
against its token's user SID before sending any bytes, including when the token's default owner is BUILTIN\Administrators. Another
user, a group owner or a missing SID is refused. This does not grant a service-mode server access to an otherwise unidentifiable peer.
The parent-child pipe is not created with the reject-remote-clients flag and a
client reaches it through `\\127.0.0.1\pipe\<name>` as well; it is limited to the current account by its DACL and
is not claimed to be network-isolated. A Unix socket is bound only in a directory with no group or other
permission bits, is never created over an existing file, is set to mode 0600 and is removed when the listener is
unbound; the client refuses a symbolic link.

A parent-child server does not read the peer process or user of an accepted connection (a service-mode server does; see above). Authentication of the child is the launch secret's
proof (WP-08.02, above), the connection binding and the owner-only endpoint, not an OS identity: a same-user process that learns an
endpoint's address can connect to it and get a challenge, and only the proof decides what it may do. What reading the peer would
take, within the repository's rules: on Windows the process id of a pipe client needs `GetNamedPipeClientProcessId`, a native
binding that the repository's closed `LibraryImport` map (architecture tests) does not allow this project; the managed
`NamedPipeServerStream.GetImpersonationUserName` returns the client's user name only when the client connects at identification level or
above (this library's client uses the anonymous level, for which it fails), and the account's SID needs impersonation level, which
would give the parent the child's token. For the launch-bound streams the design prefers, socket peer credentials name the creating parent,
not the child (annex 09). `Socket.GetRawSocketOption` could read `SO_PEERCRED` on Linux without a native binding but is not used.
Pipe-name squatting by another process of the same user is contained by the unguessable per-launch names and the client's owner check; the
owner check against a foreign pipe is not tested, and no wrong-user denial has been observed.

## Validation

`Tests/` (`ArcForges.LocalRpc.Tests`) runs offline in CI: real Kestrel HTTP/2 and Grpc.Net.Client over
in-memory duplex streams, with raw HTTP/2 and gRPC frame fixtures. Opt-in local OS checks, skipped by default and
in hosted CI, exercise a real Named Pipe, a real Unix-domain-socket code path and the absence of a TCP
listener for the process:

```powershell
$env:ARCFORGES_LOCALRPC_OS_STREAMS = '1'
dotnet test --project src/BuildingBlocks/ArcForges.LocalRpc/Tests/ArcForges.LocalRpc.Tests.csproj -c Release
```

The launch directory, owner-only and sweep checks are ordinary file-system tests that also run in hosted CI; the Windows
access-control and the Unix mode checks each run only on their own platform. A second opt-in class
(`LocalRpcLaunchProcessChecks`, same variable) starts real helper processes from the test assembly through
`DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS`: concurrent launches from four processes, a parent killed without cleanup followed by a sweep, and a
launch-authorized server over a real endpoint whose bound child is killed.

The call-bounds tests run offline in CI over real Kestrel HTTP/2 and Grpc.Net.Client on in-memory streams, with a manual
clock for queue deadlines and the handshake and idle limits and a hand-written test-only service (`BoundsProbe`) standing in
for the cancellation and health methods, which the pinned Platform contract does not have (`CancelSession` is in the Sandbox
contract, which this repository does not admit). Bootstrap and lease renewal use the real generated `LocalBootstrapService`.
One opt-in check runs the 16/64 saturation, a typed refusal, a health call and a cancel over a real Named Pipe and AF_UNIX.

The registration tests (`LocalBootstrapProof`, `LocalRpcRegistrationTests`, `LocalRpcRegistrationGateTests`,
`LocalRpcChildRegistrationTests`) run offline in CI: the registration state machine on a fake clock and fake timers, the gate over real
Kestrel HTTP/2 with the generated `LocalBootstrapService` and connector services on in-memory streams, the call bounds
under saturation, and real-clock tests with short leases. One opt-in class (same variable) runs registration over a real Named Pipe
(Windows) and a real Unix-socket path, and with a real child process that reads its bootstrap resource from its inherited standard input,
registers, renews, and is killed (`LocalRpcRegistrationOsChecks`, helper mode `register`).

The brokered-transfer tests (`LocalRpcBroker*Tests`) run offline in CI: the slot protocol against in-process stand-ins for the shared
mappings (a byte array a test can change between chunk reads, make short or failing, or watch for being disposed while read), a manual
clock for the lease, the cancel grace and the early timer, a clock whose timers never fire for the lazy expiry checks, real-clock cases
(60 short leases, a renewed session, a many-thread run that checks one copy at a time, a mapping never disposed while read, and an
end-once, release-once invariant), and an end-to-end case over real Kestrel HTTP/2 with a hand-written test-only helper service. That
case moves 6 MiB through grants, seals and acknowledgements with no message larger than a descriptor, shows a cancel taking a reserved
control slot behind 16 active and 64 queued data calls (and, as a control, the same cancel refused when it is not declared a control
method), and characterizes the stalled-reader limit above. The helper service is not the generated `ContentSandboxService`; its wire
layout is invented for the test. Claimant-reported local results (Windows, one workstation, every heavy step through the build slot):
the whole `ArcForges.LocalRpc.Tests` project 654 tests, 25 skipped (opt-in and platform checks), 0 failed in three consecutive full runs
on the final tree. 196 hand-written one-at-a-time mutants of the broker (guards, bounds, state transitions, clocks, cleanup) were built
and run against the broker test classes in a scratch copy: in the first pass 177 failed a test (one by hanging), 9 survived and 10 were rejected by the
compiler or analyzers. Of the survivors, two were equivalent (a stride check implied by the length interval, which was removed, and a
copy that still copied) and two were redundant clauses that were removed; the other five exposed missing tests (an acknowledgement for
slot 3 of 3, timer disposal after a close, the refusal counter of the copy call, an empty input, a repeated cancel after dispose), which were added,
and their mutants fail now. The rejected edits were re-expressed so that they compile and fail a test. No log of the runs is stored in the repository.
One timing-sensitive Windows test of an earlier task (`OnWindowsARenameThatAHandleBlocksIsRetried...`, a 60 ms handle release against a
360 ms retry window) failed in 4 of 5 full runs while the new tests ran at full load and passed 3 of 3 once the new many-thread case was
made lighter and the heavier classes joined the shared heavy-test collection; it is unchanged by this task.

Hosted CI never executes those checks and a successful run on one OS says nothing about the others.

The routing tests (`LocalRpcRoutingTests`, `LocalRpcRoutingWireTests`) run offline in CI: the declarations and the router on the
registration fixtures' fake clock and process table, the guard on every kind of call over a counting invoker, and the guard and a
server's declared service set over real Kestrel HTTP/2 with the generated `LocalBootstrapService` and `ConnectorBrokerService` on
in-memory streams (no Sandbox contract is admitted, so the sandbox service name in them is data only).

Refusal of a second operating-system account cannot be shown under one account. [`Tests/wrong-user-procedure.md`](Tests/wrong-user-procedure.md)
is the runnable procedure for it: a second, standard Windows account against the Named Pipe endpoint, the library client against a pipe
that account owns, the launch root, and the launch and registration endpoints over a Named Pipe and a Unix socket; and a second, non-root
Linux uid against the plain, launch and registration Unix sockets. Each step names its expected line and exit code and the controls
before and after it that show the endpoint was live. The procedure drives `wrong-user-*` helper modes of the test assembly, reached only
through `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` and `ARCFORGES_LOCALRPC_HELPER`. Their parsing, outcome classification, guards and exit codes are tested
offline in CI (`LocalRpcWrongUserProcedureTests`), and `LocalRpcWrongUserProcedureChecks` (same opt-in variable) runs them under one
account as controls only. The procedure has not been run: wrong-user denial is blocked on a second Windows account, not proven, and
blocked on a second Linux uid, not proven.

Completion follow-up runs (2026-10-11; claimant-reported, each run once through the build slot, at branch head
