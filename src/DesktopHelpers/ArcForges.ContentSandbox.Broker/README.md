# ArcForges.ContentSandbox.Broker

The parent side of the content helper (WP-11.09, PLT.45): restricted launch, the closed resource inventory, registration, the session, brokered
buffers and supervision. This project is non-packable. Helper and broker packaging is out of scope, not completed: PLT.46 was narrowed to the
four Security packages (coordinator ruling S52(1); P2-026 item 20), so no broker package exists or is claimed.

```csharp
await using var launcher = new ContentSandboxLauncher(new ContentSandboxLaunchOptions
{
    HelperPath = installedHelper,        // the signed helper of this installation
    HelperSha256 = pinnedDigest,         // from the installed signed inventory
    ParserProfile = "…",                 // chosen by the helper build, never a path
    RuntimeRoot = ownerOnlyDirectory,
});
var launched = await launcher.LaunchAsync(inputBytes);   // typed failure when no restricted profile can run
await using var invocation = launched.Value!;
var image = await invocation.OpenImageAsync(0, 0, 1);
using var tile = (await invocation.ReadImageTileAsync(image.Value, 0, 0, 256, 256)).Value!;   // bytes verified on a private copy
```

- **No fallback.** A platform without a verified profile (macOS, which is not a supported platform, an unknown OS, a failed AppContainer or self-check) fails with
  `security.isolation_unavailable`, starts nothing, and never parses in process.
- **Windows (`Windows/`).** The helper is opened with writers refused and its SHA-256 compared with the pin; an AppContainer identity is leased from
  a pool of eight (a lock file per identity, released by the OS if the owner ends); the process is created suspended with a handle list naming
  exactly its closed inventory (two private pipes whose child ends are opened overlapped and never bound to a completion port here, a read-only
  duplicate of the input section, up to three output sections, standard input for the launch frame and standard output for diagnostics), a minimal
  environment and mitigation policies; its token is read back and must be that AppContainer with no capability before the thread resumes; a
  non-breakaway Job Object (kill on close, one process, a memory limit, no user-interface access) is attached first. Parent death closes the job and ends the helper. Renaming or deleting the helper file is refused while its handle is held. The helper is pinned by SHA-256 only. Disclosed residuals (not PLT.45 acceptance): there is no Authenticode signature verification of the helper; and the pooled AppContainer identities are reused one after another and keep their per-container storage between invocations, so data a hostile parser leaves there could be seen by a later invocation on the same identity; no test covers it and nothing cleans the container on release. win-arm64: blocked on a Windows ARM64 host, not proven.
- **Linux (`Linux/`).** Descriptors are created close-on-exec and placed at fixed numbers by a spawn plan; the helper restricts itself. Output slots are memfds sealed against shrinking and growing (a hostile helper cannot truncate one under the parent's copy); every parent descriptor above the inventory is closed by the plan. The helper file is hashed through a handle that blocks writers, but on Linux a rename in the install directory is not blocked: the install directory must be unwritable for the user. Linux containment: blocked on a Linux kernel with multithread Landlock (TSYNC), not proven. On 2026-10-11 the opt-in `LinuxOsIsolationTests` ran in WSL2 Debian 13 (kernel `6.18.40.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2`, Landlock ABI 7, `landlock_restrict_self` with the TSYNC flag answering EINVAL): this launcher started the published Native AOT fixture, which refused before any parser ran (`security.isolation_unavailable`, `exit=70`, `isolation: landlock-tsync refused (22)`) and was reaped; a helper that is not the pinned build was never started; the output slots (`LinuxSealedMemory`) carried SHRINK, GROW and SEAL seals and refused shrinking and growing with EPERM. No Linux containment pass is claimed; the kernel facts, the procedure and what was not observed are in the helper README.
- **Supervision.** One generated call at a time; a transport failure, a deadline or a misbehaving result ends the invocation and returns
  `resource.parser_failed` or `resource.integrity_failed`. Cancellation uses the reserved control slot; the session lease is renewed every 10 s.
- **Native bindings** (`Native/`): the exact libc and Windows calls above, each unique in the repository and listed in the closed native-binding map of the architecture tests.
